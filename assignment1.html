            What is it? 
            </p>
    <p>
        A press-fit kit made of icosahedral shapes- hexagons and pentagons with 3 "fit-points" on each side. 
        The idea was to create a kit that allows people to create abstarct figures. The concept is inspired by shapes like the icosahedron and icosidodecahedron.
        Although there are 3 points of contact, only 2 are used to connect two pieces together. The extra point is meant to support addetional connections.
