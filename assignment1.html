            <h4>
            What is it? 
            </h4>
    <p>
        A press-fit kit made of icosahedral shapes- hexagons and pentagons with 3 "fit-points" on each side. 
        The idea was to create a kit that allows people to create abstarct figures. The concept is inspired by shapes like the icosahedron and icosidodecahedron.
        Although there are 3 points of contact, only 2 are used to connect two pieces together. The extra point is meant to support addetional connections.

    <h4>
        The Design
    </h4>
    <p>
        Experimented with Rhino and Illustrator. Key takeaway: 3D programs like Solidworks or Rhino are much better for designing 3D/geometric shapes,
        especially when mirrioring or transforming objects. 
        Hindsight:The corner joints have to be slightly smaller and rounded for better fit.

<h4>
    What can you make?
</h4>
<p>
    A hexagonal dome? A basket? A collapsed icosahedral model?

<p>
    All of the above!!! You can make normal shapes look weird with hexagons!!!
