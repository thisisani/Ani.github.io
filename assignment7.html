            <h4>
            What is it? 
            </h4>
    <p>
   Fabrication of the original ARC Reactor from the Iron-Man movies. This model will also function as a lamp/flashlight.

    <h4>
        The Process & Design
    </h4>
    <p>
The design has multiple layers and thus will be fabricated using different techniques.

     <p> Rudimentary sketches of my design.</p>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p> The top piece will be CNC milled/3D printed( I will do both to decide which material suits the design better).
    The center piece will be laser cut with delrin or Acrylic.
    2-piece box structures will be CNC milled and attached to the center layer. Copper wire would then be rolled onto these pieces.</p>
    <p> A circular layer will be CNC milled to accommodate the mini Flash LEDs, this layer will be the 3rd layer of the structure.
    Finally, the base/last layer will be 3d printed. </p>
    
    <p> The files will be designed in Rhino-Grasshopper and Illustrator. 
    
    <h4> Time Line</h4> 
    
   Most of the project work will be done during the weekend of June 1st/ 2nd. 
   
   <h4>BOM</h4>
   <p>1. Flash LEDs</p>
   <p>2. Delrin/Acrylic</p>
   <p>3.PLA Filament</p>
   <p>4. FR1 and FR4</p>
   <p>5. Copper Gauge</p>
   <p>6. Misc tools</p>
   
   <p> The materials will be bought from the Mill or AMAZON.
