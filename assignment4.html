            What is it? 
            </h4>
    <p>
     A simple geared assembly that simulates a robot's end effector. Counteracting gears are used for the opening and closing action and a smaller gear is used to drive the motion.The mechanism here is neither geared up or geared down, but uses a 1:1 gearing ratio. 
        
            </p>
    
    <h4>
        The Process
    </h4>
    <p>
  I decided to create a test prototype initially and therefore used onshape to create the gears individually. The end effectors were designed in illustrator in order to be laser-cut.
  0.3 Inch holes were drilled on the gears and a linear piece of wood. The Push-in rivets were used to fasten the gears onto the linear piece of wood. The end-effectors were then glued to the gears.

     <p>The parts!!! The gears were 3d printed with PLA and the end effectors were laser-cut from scrap wood.</p>

   1.0 Testing!!!

<p>
    This model was created as a simple test and therefore lacks precision in the rivet holes and gear movement. As for the 2.0, I plan to model
    the entire assembly on onshape and use a motor to drive the gearing mechanism.
