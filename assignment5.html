            What is it? 
            </h4>
    <p>
    A CNC milled box with a slotted design. The top and bottom surfaces have slots that accommodate the 4 side pieces. The box is designed to accommodate an LED and project the shadow of the shape milled out of
    one of the pieces. 
        
            </p>
    
    <h4>
        The Process
    </h4>
    <p>
 I designed the individual sides of the box on illustrator. Measuring the thickness of the FR4 boards, I accordingly designed the slots for each side. I exported the DXF file from illustrator
 and created a .gbr file using KiCad. Finally, I loaded the gbr file into the bantam tools software to start with the milling. Facing some scaling issues with the size of the slots while exporting, 
 I had to use a 0.1x scaling factor in KiCad.

            </p>
      
     <p>The parts!!! The individual pieces were milled out of FR4 with 2 of the sides modified to accommodate the LED and projection shadow.</p>
