          The concept 
                 
            </h4>

    <p>
    By borrowing elements from the ARC reactor- a miniature fusion reactor from Marvel's Iron Man movies, I decided to design a light source.
    The design will show elements like exposed copper chambers and circular layers on a cylendrical body. apart from these borrowed elements, the 
    design has been modified to be a desk piece/ lamp. The size has been scaled by a factor of 1.2 and is designed to be placed in both up-right and 
    lateral positions. My design also features exposed wood and raw copper layers. It is also simplified and accomodates 4 seperate layers combined together.

    <h4>
        The Design and Development 
    </h4>
    <h5> The Electromagnetic Layer</h5>
    <p>
    This layer is the second layer and largest in diameter. Based on the design featured in the first iron-man movie, it resembles the
    electromagnetic layer. This layer has multiple elements. Firstly, hollow circular structures were designed to laser-cut. Designing the files 
    on Illustrator, the elemets were cut out of delrin. 3 layers were fused together to increase thickness. 


         <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>
            Secondly, "pressfit" rectangular clips were designed to fit on the delrin. 2 of these units were combined to form one enclosed element.
            The structures were designed in illustrator and exported as a DXF. Then they were scaled in KI-CAD and then exported as a edge cuts file.
            The final file was CNC Milled on the bantam desktop mill. These structures were fabricated using FR1.

            <p> Finally, the structures were clipped onto thr delrin and wound with copper wiring.</p>

       <h5> The TOP Layer </h5>
       <p> The top layer consists of 2 pieces of FR1 and once piece of circular wood. The triangualr logo was designed in Rhino and exported as a DXF. 
       The structure was then millled on the bantam tools desktop mill. The circular wooden structure was designed in illustrator and cut using the laser cutter. 
       These individual elements were then glued together. Finally this layer was fitted on top of the middle layer. </p>

<h5> The 3rd Layer </h5>

<p>
The third layer consists of a circular FR1 piece milled out of FR1 and 4 Flash LEDs along the perimeter. The structure was designed in illustrator and milled 
on the bantam desktop mill. The LEDs were then glued onto the FR1 with the wires leading out of the structure.

            <h5> The base Layer</h5>
            <p> The base layer is the largest layer in the design. It has the same diamenter as the center layer and holds all the layers above it. 
            The base layer consists of a cylendrical shape with angled rectangular support structures. The structure was designed in Rhino and was 3D printed 
                using PLA. </p>

<h4>The final product</h4>
<p> The final product is the combination of all the 4 layers fitted together. A wire is extended through the base to supply power to the LEDs.</p>
