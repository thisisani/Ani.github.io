            What is it? 
            </h4>
    <p>
       Joints!!!. A press fit kit with flexible joints. The kit uses hexagonal shapes as base units and smaller rectangular joints to connect 
       the base units. Building on the 1.0 kit, the idea was to create a more dynamic kit that allows the user to be flexible with creating models.

    <h4>
        The Process
    </h4>
    <p>
       Grasshopper was used to generate the polygonal base units in Rhino. The hexagon has 6 slots, one on each side that accommodates the rectangular joints.
       I had to experiment with joint sizes as the fit had to be neither tight nor loose to accommodate the flexibility of the joints.
       The file was designed in millimeters and scaled with a 5x facotr to create appropriate sizes to print using the laser cutter.
       The rhino file was then exported to illustrator(.ai) to process in the laser cutter.

            </p>
      
     <p> The Kit uses 2 materials- White foam board and standard brown cardboard. Some of the base units have modified slots to accommodate
both the materials. </p>
